# Study Guide

## Recommended Path

All of these are essential to success.

1. Fundamentals (language) [Importance: 5/5]
Go over how to do certain tasks in language of choice. For example, heap, deque, uniform random, shuffle, sort, binary search, string and array methods. Understand time and space complexity of functions within your programming language.

2. Neetcode 150 [Importance: 5/5]
Baseline leetcode required to be competent. You *can* skip DP/bit sections until later, as these are rare unless you are applying to a specific niche company.

3. Leetcode Templates [Importance: 3/5]
Given various leetcode problems, there are templates that allow for typing faster solutions. Memorize these templates.

4. Systems Design (for SDE2+) [Importance: 5/5]
Lots of material. Determine your short-term and long-term goals. Short-term, you can practice against example videos on SDFC. You can read examples in Alex Xu Vol 1/2. Long-term, you need more detail present in DDIA and other cited engineering sources to base your depth on - such as product internals, QPS, RTT, machine count.

5. Multithreading [Importance: 1/5]
Determine how multithreading should be written in your chosen programming language. A common way to block candidates is to ask to re-write a solution to be multithreaded. This was popularized at dropbox. 

x. OOP [Importance: 0/5]
If going to the couple companies that do this, like Amazon, then memorize the OOP patterns as they are written differently in your chosen programming language.

## REACTO Method

For leetcode problems, follow the [REACTO](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/whiteboard-coding-interviews-a-6-step-process-to-solve-any-problem) method. Fullstack academy invented it, and it hits all the points CTCI made, with more depth.

### Personal Modifications

I recommend a modified version. 

"O - optimization" - First, I think it saves everyone time to think of the most optimal way of doing something, at the *first step*, before jumping in and potentially wasting time on a sub-optimal solution. So if you are in "R - Repeat," use that time to actually think about optimization.

"E - Examples," - after you have the question and specifics down, write unit tests. When you provide an example, write it directly into the code. This demonstrates competency in writing tests, and saves time. If you can run the code, then this becomes even more helpful.

## Company Specific

If you are targeting a specific company, you should also complete most of their problems in leetcode.
