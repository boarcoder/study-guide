# Multithreading

- Some companies, such as `dropbox`, require `threading` to be used in a solution.
- This repo explores some possible word problems.

## Companies

- dropbox: frequently asks for soltions to be threaded.
- github: I was asked to change a solution for a message queue to be threaded, such that failed responses would be retried on another thread, instead of just moved to back of the priority queue.
