Put a time when u want to do. I will pay $160 for 1 hr. You need to have question you will ask and grade according to some score card include:
- Qualifies for SDE2/L4 [Y/N]
- Qualifies for SDE3/L5 [Y/N]
- Adequately explains trade-offs on components
- Provides strongly consistent solution if required, or not if not required (QPS more important)
- Provides correct components for optimal performance
- Fluency on partial failures
- Fluency on partition keys, seconday index
- Machine count estimates
- Hot partition issue - if present
- Streaming analytics - if streaming is part - how is it implementd?
- Understands consensus algorithm of components which were selected (if present)
- Understands whether chosen component(s) uses B-tree, LSM-tree, R-tree, quad-tree, inverted index.
- Fluency on isolation levels
