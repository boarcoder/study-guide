# Readme

You are provided the *absolute path* representing current working directory `cwd` in a unix-style file system. Additionally, you are given a relative path denoted as `cd` which instructs a change to the current working directory. Your task is to determine and output the **simplified canonical path** that results from applying the relative path, `cd`, to the initial `cwd`
